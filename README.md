# Portfolio-Stacker

This is a simple application with a React/NextJS front-end & Express/GraphQL/KeystoneJS backend.

Application Stack:

- Postgres
- React (NextJS)
- NodeJS
- KeystoneJS (Express & ApolloServer)

Here's everything this application will include:

- User Login and Registration
- CRUD Operations
- Permissions
- File Upload

Here's the problem this application solves:

- Developers want to quickly share their portfolio without setting up a website. This could be used as a simple portfolio page generator.

## Backend Overhaul
I'm recreating the backend using Keystone 6 because it's more of a batteries included backend. The GraphQL queries and mutations are generated along with the schema all at once. This saves massive amounts of time/money when creating a graphql api.
